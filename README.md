## Task 4: Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning
**Objective:** Build a model to classify emails as "Spam" or "Ham" (Non-Spam).

**Key Steps:**
1. Preprocessed text data (Removed garbage columns, renamed labels).
2. Converted text to numbers using **CountVectorizer** (Bag of Words).
3. Trained a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** model.
4. Achieved an impressive **98.4% Accuracy**.
5. Minimized False Positives (Only 2 real emails were misclassified).

**Technology Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn (Naive Bayes), Pandas, NLP.

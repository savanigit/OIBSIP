## Task 3: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
**Objective:** Train a machine learning model to predict the selling price of a car based on its features.

**Key Steps:**
1. Loaded the dataset and handled "messy" data (dropped 'Car_Name').
2. Preprocessed categorical features (Fuel Type, Transmission) into numerical values using Manual Encoding.
3. Visualized correlations using a Seaborn Heatmap.
4. Trained a Linear Regression model.
5. Achieved an R-Squared score of **0.84**, indicating a strong predictive performance.

**Technology Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn.

# OIBSIP Internship Tasks

## Task 1: Iris Flower Classification
**Objective:** Train a machine learning model to classify iris flowers based on their measurements.

**Key Steps:**
1. Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
2. Visualized the data using Seaborn (Pairplots) to understand linear separability.
3. Split the data into Training (80%) and Testing (20%) sets.
4. Trained a Logistic Regression model.
5. Achieved an accuracy score of 100%.
6. Tested the model on custom inputs to verify real-world performance.

**Technology Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn.
